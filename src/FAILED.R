# Failed species & reason -------------------------------------------------

# By increasing the raster buffer and doing the raster mask it seems that I've solved the error:
## Error in envBlock(rasterLayer = envstack, speciesData = PB_data, species = "Species",  : The input raster layer does not cover all the species points ##

# By settting randomtestpoints arg to 0 in maxent I've solved the following error:
# Warning: Skipping species because it has 0 test samples


# Arthroleptella lightfooti -----------------------------------------------
# NOT RUNNING THIS UNTIL WE HAVE MORE FINE SCALE DATA

# Breviceps branchi -------------------------------------------------------
# NOT RUNNING - only one valid data point at this stage
